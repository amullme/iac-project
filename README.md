# iac-project Summary
This project combines different components into stacks for launch on multiple platforms.

# My motive
1-29-25 -- I'm publishing this repo as a learning tool for myself to learn as many components of a microservices architechture as quickly as possible. I have a sys-admin, networking, customer facing, and confluence document writing background. I also know Python and Git enough to write scripts somewhat competently. I need to learn devops and microservices as fast a possible. The focus of this repo is learning breadth rather than depth. But I tried to structure this repo to also support in depth learning as needed.

# How this project is organized
- Switch branches to work with different stacks.
- Read the README.md file in the root of each branch which provide instructions to combine components. [^1]

[^1]: If a no branch exists, it's probably a work in progress.
