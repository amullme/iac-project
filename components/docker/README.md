# iac-project/docker/ Objective
Select a base image, create a Dockerfile using the contents in folder ./python/flask-hello, build the image, and push it to Dockerhub.

# Steps
1. Optional: If you want to change my base image, select base image from Dockerhub: https://vsupalov.com/choose-base-image/. I chose python:3.12
1. Optional: If you want, edit my Dockerfile by following the comments within the file

### this part needs work
1. build the image (need a safe place to build the image and maybe a safe place to test python and use a VENV for requirments.txt)
1. push the image to docker hub
